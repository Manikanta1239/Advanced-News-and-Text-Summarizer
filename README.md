# Advanced News and Text Summarizer

## Overview

This project is a web-based application developed with Streamlit, designed to summarize text, documents, and news articles. It provides functionalities such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and language detection. The app leverages pre-trained models like T5 and BART for text summarization, with additional support for extracting text from PDFs and images.

## Features

- **Summarize Text**: Enter text directly to generate a concise summary.
- **Summarize Document**: Upload PDFs or image files to extract and summarize content.
- **Summarize News Article**: Input a URL to fetch, analyze, and summarize the article.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the emotional tone of the input text.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identify key terms from the text for quick insights.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detect the language of the input text.
- **Visualization**: Display sentiment analysis results using interactive charts.
